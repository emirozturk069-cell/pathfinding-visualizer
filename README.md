# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer developed as part of an academic assignment.

The application demonstrates and compares the behavior of different pathfinding algorithms such as:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra
- A* (Manhattan heuristic)
- A* (Euclidean heuristic)

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to visually analyze how different algorithms behave on different maps and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pygame (if used)
- Graph-based pathfinding algorithms

## Team Members
This project was developed collaboratively by:

- **Emir Orhun Öztürk** (GitHub: emirozturk069-cell)
- **Omer GUNDOGDU** (GitHub: HEXDEG)
- **Alperen KAHRAMAN** (GitHub:)

## Notes
This repository is used for academic evaluation and demonstration purposes.
